# The "bare" package names can be intimidating, so you can use subgroups
# to provide human-readable names while hiding the packages themselves.
# This also allows you you group related packages -- suppose you feel
# that KDevelop should be installed always with PHP and Python support,
# but that support is split into multiple packages.
#
# So this subgroup (IDE) contains subgroups, one for each "package"
# we want to install. Each of those subgroups (Emacs, KDevelop)
# in turn contains **one** bogus subgroup, which then has the list
# of relevant packages. This extra-level-of-subgrouping allows us
# to list packages, while giving human-readable names.
#
# The name of the internal subgroup doesn't matter -- it is hidden
# from the user -- so we can give them all bogus names and
# descriptions, even the same name. Here, we use "Bogus". You
# can re-use the subgroup name, it doesn't really matter.
#
# Each internal subgroup is set to *hidden*, so it does not show up
# as an entry in the list, and it is set to *selected*,
# so that if you select its parent subgroup, the packages from
# the subgroup are selected with it and get installed.
